Power BI for data visualization and insights.

Data Sources: The dashboard integrates data from a single table (.csv file) to provide a holistic view of the Facebook data.

Data Cleaning and Transformation: The initial data contained various irregularities, including NULL values, incorrect data entries, improperly formatted data, and empty cells. To ensure accurate and reliable analysis, rigorous data cleaning and transformation activities were performed using Power BI:

Data Profiling: Analyzed the data to understand its structure, quality, and relationships. Handling Missing Data: Replaced or removed NULL values and empty cells to maintain data integrity. Data Transformation: Reformatted data to ensure consistency and accuracy, including parsing dates, correcting data types, and standardizing units of measurement. Data Validation: Verified the accuracy of data entries against known standards and business rules. Filtering Unnecessary Data: Removed irrelevant or redundant data points to enhance the dashboard's focus and performance.

The dashboard is designed to help users analyze Facebook user performance, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions to optimize operations and strategies within the business.

NOTE: The original CSV file contained various irregularities, including NULL values, incorrect data, improperly formatted data, and empty cells, all of which were addressed during the creation of the dashboard using Power BI.
